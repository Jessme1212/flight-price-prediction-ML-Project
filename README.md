# Flight Fare Prediction | Machine Learning Project

A machine learning project to predict flight prices based on real-world data, using Python and scikit-learn. This project demonstrates end to end data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, model optimization, and pipeline automation.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Flight Fare Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh/code)
- The dataset includes flight details such as airline, date of journey, source/destination, stops, duration, and price.

## Key Steps

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
  - Handled missing values
  - Converted date and time columns to numerical features
  - Split duration into hours and minutes

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**
  - Analyzed flight trends, pricing based on airline and duration
  - Visualized data using Seaborn and Matplotlib

- **Feature Engineering**
  - Extracted day, month, and weekday from journey date
  - Created meaningful numerical and categorical features

- **Encoding Techniques**
  - One-hot encoding and target-guided encoding applied to categorical variables

- **Feature Selection**
  - Used Mutual Information and model-based techniques to identify important features

- **Modeling & Evaluation**
  - Built a regression model using scikit-learn
  - Hyperparameter tuning with `RandomizedSearchCV`
  - Automated model pipeline and saved using `joblib`

## Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Outcome

- Developed a robust machine learning model with solid performance
- Created an automated and reusable ML pipeline
- Demonstrated strong skills in data analysis, feature engineering, and model optimization
